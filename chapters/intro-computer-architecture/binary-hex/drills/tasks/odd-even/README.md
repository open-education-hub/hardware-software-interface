# Binary Even and Hexadecimal Odd

You will solve the exercise starting from the file `odd_even.c` located in the directory `drills/tasks/odd-even/`.

Traverse an array of 32-bit integers using pointer operations and display the even numbers in binary and the odd numbers in hexadecimal.

>**NOTE**: Use bitwise operations wherever possible in your solution!

>**NOTE**: For the array `[214, 71, 84, 134, 86]`, the program will display:
>
> ```text
> 0b11010110
> 0x00000047
> 0b01010100
> 0b10000110
> 0b01010110
> ```
