# Reversing a String

You will solve the exercise starting from the file `mirror.c` located in the directory `drills/tasks/mirror/support/`.

Using pointer operations, implement a C program that reverses a string of characters.
The `mirror` function should perform an **in-place** reversal of the characters in the string (upon exiting the function, the input string will contain the reversed string).

> **NOTE**: Do not access string elements using the form `s[i]`.

> **TIP**:
>
> ```c
> mirror("AnaAreMere") = "ereMerAanA"
>
> mirror("asdfghjl") = "ljhgfdsa"
>
> mirror("qwerty") = "ytrewq"
> ```
